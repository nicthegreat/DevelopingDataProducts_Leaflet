## Instructions

Instructions to the Coursera course "Create a web page using R Markdown and Leaflet" in Week 2 of Developing Data Products are as follows:

1. Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

2. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

3. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Create Map using Leaflet package

### Who lives here?

```{r leaflet}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=1.249595, lng= 103.844387, popup="Nick Young lives here")
my_map
```
